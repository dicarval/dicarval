# 💫 About Me:

I'm **Diogo Carvalho Santos**, a programming student currently working to level up my skills at [42 School Lisbon](https://42lisboa.com/).

- 🌱 Currently diving deep into **C++**, **Docker** and exploring computer science fundamentals.
- 🏫 Studying at **42 Lisboa**, a peer-to-peer coding school with a hands-on, project-based curriculum and learning by building, failing and trying again.
- ⚡ Transitioning from **financial audit** to **software development** has been one of the biggest challenges of my life, but also one of the best, totally worth it.
